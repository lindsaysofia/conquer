# Website Replication

NOT my design!

I attempted to recreate this website, https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer, but instead of using Bootstrap, I used Flexbox and Grid. I had a lot of fun with the design and it was my first time using background attachment in CSS; such a fun design!
